## About Dominion

Dominion is a strategic deck-building card game where players compete to build the most efficient deck and accumulate the highest score. Players begin with a small deck of cards and acquire additional cards from a shared pool throughout the game. Each card has unique abilities that can shape strategies, making every game session unique and challenging. With multiple expansions, Dominion offers endless replayability and customization.
